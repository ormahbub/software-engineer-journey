# Git Practice

Learning Git like a Software Engineer <br/>
I must have to write code everyday. <br/>

### Must I have do everyday - Even if I study only 30 minutes:

#### 3. Commit something

## Note: Zero commit days are not allowed (except rest day).

# Software Engineer Journey 🚀

## About Me

I am currently working as a WordPress Developer.
I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP (basic), and website development.
Now, I am transitioning into a highly skilled Software Engineer.

## My Goal

My goal is to become a highly skilled Full-Stack Software Engineer with strong problem-solving ability,
deep understanding of JavaScript, frontend and backend engineering, and clean coding practices.

I want to build scalable, maintainable, real-world applications — not just websites.

## Why I Am Doing This

I believe software engineering is not about tools or frameworks,
but about thinking, problem-solving, and building systems that last.

I want:

- Strong technical depth
- Long-term career growth
- Respect as an engineer
- Opportunities in product-based and remote companies

## Learning Path

I am following a structured, step-by-step roadmap covering:

- Core JavaScript (deep understanding)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Frontend Engineering (React, TypeScript)
- Backend Engineering (Node.js, Express, Databases)
- Software Engineering principles
- Real-world projects

## Daily Commitment

- I will code **6 days a week**
- I will commit to GitHub daily
- I will focus on understanding, not memorizing
- I will build projects alongside learning

## Rules I Will Follow

- No tutorial hoarding
- No skipping fundamentals
- No copying code blindly
- Build before moving forward
- Consistency over motivation

## Final Promise

This repository will document my honest journey —
including mistakes, learning, and growth.

I am committed to becoming a professional software engineer.
